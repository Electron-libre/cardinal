# Format hook

## Intent

The `PostToolUse` hook `cardinal run format-code` (Edit|Write) formats the file the agent just edited with the
project's format command, `cargo fmt` when the project declares none, so the agent never spends a turn on formatting.

## Requirements

- **FMT-1** (deterministic) The hook must read the format command from the string `format_command` and the format patterns from the list of strings `format_files` of the `[project]` table of the `.claude/cardinal.toml` at the root of the work tree holding the edited file (`tool_input.file_path` of the event), each pattern matching a file name, `*` standing for any run of characters; `format_files` absent, every file name matches. Without `format_command`, or when the file is missing, does not parse or gives a key of another type, the format command is `cargo fmt --all` over the patterns `*.rs`.
- **FMT-2** (deterministic) The hook must run nothing when the event has no `file_path`, when the edited file is under a `.claude` directory of its work tree (Cardinal's copies) or its name matches no format pattern, and when the declared format command is empty or blank.
- **FMT-3** (deterministic) The hook must run a declared format command with `sh -c`, from the root of the work tree holding the edited file, with the path of the edited file as its last argument.
- **FMT-4** (deterministic) The hook must exit 0 and print nothing, whatever the format command prints or returns: formatting is best-effort, and a syntax error mid-edit does not block the agent.

## Scenarios

- **FMT-H1** (happy; FMT-1, FMT-3, FMT-4) Given a project that declares its format command and the files it formats,
  when the agent edits one of those files, then the command formats it from the root of the work tree and the agent
  sees nothing.

- (FMT-1) Given a Rust project with no `format_command`, when the agent edits a `.rs` file, then `cargo fmt --all` runs from the directory of that file (PAR-12).
- (FMT-3) Given `format_command = "npx prettier --write"` and `format_files = ["*.ts"]`, when the agent edits `src/a.ts`, then `npx prettier --write <path of src/a.ts>` runs from the root of the work tree.
- (FMT-2) Given the same project, when the agent edits `README.md`, then nothing runs.

## Non-goals

- Formatting the files the agent changes otherwise than by Edit or Write (a `sed`, a generator): `cardinal run project-check` catches them.
- Reporting a formatter that fails: the lint gate and `cardinal run project-check` report what is wrong with the code.
